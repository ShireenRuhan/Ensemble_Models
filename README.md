# Predicting Passenger Satisfaction:Comparative Study of Ensemble Learning Techniques
# Project Description:
This is a follow along project that I did as a part of the Google Advance Data Analytics-Nuts and Bolts of Ml course.The aim was to develop a predictive model to determine passenger satisfaction based on data collected by an airlines. **The project compares the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.** The goal is to identify the model that provides the most accurate and reliable predictions for passenger satisfaction.
# File Description:
This repository contains three jupyter notebooks with the data analysed using each model seperately.
# Steps involved:
**Data Collection**

**Data Preprocessing**:data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features(when needed) is done.The data is made to be  in a suitable format for model training and evaluation

**Model Development**: Implemention of three machine learning models - Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost -to predict passenger satisfaction. Each model was trained using the collected data and **fine-tuned using appropriate hyperparameter optimization techniques**.

**Performance Evaluation**:Performance of each ensemble model was assesed by evaluating key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Techniques like **cross-validation** were used to ensure robust evaluation and comparing the models' results.

**Feature Importance Analysis**: Analysis and interpretation of the **feature importance** provided by each ensemble model was done to identify the most influential factors that contributed to passenger satisfaction and to gain insights into the underlying patterns within the dataset.

# Result and Conclusion from project:
A Table comparing key metrics from each model was created in the final notebook that showed the performance of three models.Amongst the three models, on this dataset-Tuned Random Forest emerged as champion model.
